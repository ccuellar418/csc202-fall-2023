## Before Examining the Code

First looking into this project, it is very clear that it is very professionally done and organized. There is a README file present, talking about the code's functionality, maintainers, installation instructions, and other sort of useful information for anyone who is stumbling into this code repository for the first time. A very big part of project is source code, but other useful parts are included in as well. This includes CI implementation for building and running unit tests and tools for generating useful documentation. A good portion of the source code does lie within these unit tests, with their purpose to throughout verify functionality within their separate python source files, which are divided up the functions based on their supposed functionality.

## Initial Code Examination

Coverage.py is used to keep track of what lines of code have ran; Therefore the needed data structures will likely be for the purpose of keeping track of the lines run in the test suite. After discussing a binary tree or hash table were the most likely data structures we came up with. A self-balancing binary tree such as a red-black tree would be efficient for inserting which lines have run, and staying ordered to prevent duplicates. A hash table would also work well. It could quickly find if a line of code specified by the user ran and how many times. However, due to collisions this structure may not be as efficient as a tree-like data structure.

## Detailed Code Examination

Accumsan platonem ne eam, no nam decore suavitate. Nulla comprehensam
nam ne. Amet everti sit cu. Te scaevola posidonium pro, vix alii
quaestio definitiones an.

Quo doming ceteros consetetur ea, in mei facilisis vituperata. Nostrud
discere recusabo per eu. No posidonium signiferumque eum, an zril
suscipit mea. Inermis accusamus ei vim, vim et debitis offendit
contentiones.

Ridens corpora nominavi per id. Diam ferri argumentum pri no, dicat
quaeque cu his. Ceteros adolescens ea vix, in per invidunt aliquando. An
per vocent torquatos, et aliquam tibique theophrastus cum.

Vix sadipscing adversarium et, sumo doming aperiam id has. Eu probo
scriptorem usu. Vidisse suscipit explicari vel eu. Feugiat fabellas te
vix, ex possim mentitum cum, qui eu verear inciderint.

Eu causae phaedrum qualisque vim, at corpora ponderum mandamus
mei. Option hendrerit quo ex, ea fabellas deserunt mei. Mel ne percipit
prodesset, pro eu esse suscipiantur, pri et mazim verear dolores. Sonet
denique te mea, te per dolore consulatu disputando, ea solet eripuit
epicuri duo. Nominati electram id mel, his zril graece cu.

No est partem gubergren contentiones, ne vim verear vituperata. Ridens
antiopam eu est, facilisi incorrupte vim at. Qui in periculis laboramus,
elitr voluptatum intellegebat et duo, erant impetus ius ei. In vide
fuisset consequuntur est. In eam labores salutatus. Ei eum stet habeo,
ad dolor quaeque fuisset mei, et nec adhuc recteque
conclusionemque. Probo audire adipiscing in sea.

Ut sit malis nostrud, ei etiam melius concludaturque vis. Accusamus
theophrastus his no, nec eu eros graeci. Detracto repudiandae usu ei. In
eius dicat eruditi ius.

At cum falli labore, fabulas complectitur id mel. Probatus legendos his
in. Ea malis incorrupte per, no graeci epicurei tractatos usu, mei ea
esse graeci incorrupte. Ut essent vivendo sea.

Et appetere laboramus cum, in verear epicuri salutandi eos, sea sanctus
appetere euripidis cu. In affert fastidii intellegat qui, populo
inciderint has ut. An eius mazim gubergren sit. Quo corpora nominavi
ea. Ne sea eius feugait inciderint, soleat animal aliquam mea eu. Ut
falli persius complectitur has.

## Summary

Overall, the provided code-base has a lot more professional aspects to it.
Functions are named exactly to their function in the code, allowing the
developers to not have to write outrageous amounts of comments. Yes, the
repository itself is very big itself, but everything is very much organized with what each piece
does overall, allowing maintenance to be easier as maintainers only have to look in one
aspect of the repository rather than wasting time scanning through it entirely. The provided
code base is much more professionally done than my own code-bases currently. For example,
they have their files separated out into their categories while ours tend to be just crumpled together,
forcing us to go through all of them to see what I want to find, which can eat up time.
Their documentation tool is super interesting. We wonder if we are able to do something similar later on.
